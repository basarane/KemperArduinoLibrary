# Kemper Profiler Arduino Library and DIY Kemper Remote 

This project consists of 2 sub projects:
- An Arduino library for Kemper and DIY Kemper Remote
- A simulator for this library (requires node.js and windows)

## Installation
You can use Arduino IDE for development. However I strongly suggest to use a modern IDE like Visual Studio. 

- Download and install [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
- Download and install [Arduino Extension For Visual Studio](http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-Visual-Studio-Downloads.aspx)
- Download the repository as [zip file] (https://github.com/basarane/kemper-arduino-library/archive/master.zip), or [fork the repository] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
- Optionally if you want to fork the repository, I suggest you using [GitHub Extensions for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/)

###Optional
If you want to use Simulator:

- Download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Open a command prompt. Goto `simulator` folder and run the following command:

```
cd Simulator
npm install
```
